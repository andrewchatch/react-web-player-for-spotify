# React Web Player for Spotify

This app is a clone of the Spotify Web Player built using a React frontend and an Node.js/Express backend for authentication. 

## Using this app:

First, you can clone the project directory from 'https://github.com/andrewchatch/react-web-player-for-spotify.git' or by using the GitHub CLI:

`gh repo clone andrewchatch/react-web-player-for-spotify`

Once the directory is cloned locally, you can run the app using npm:

`npm start`

Runs the front and back end using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application. (The backend runs on port 8000 by default).

## Project Intent

I built this project to further develop my skills in full-stack development. I am passionate about music and use the Spotify app on a daily basis, so I thought it would be fun to work with the Spotify API and try to re-create the web player interface.
